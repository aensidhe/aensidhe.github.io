Almost half-year no one wrote here. Let's fix that!

There were a lot going one in my life last year. I became director of engineering. Completely another world, if you compare that to world of developer. Very interesting. I'm still fascinated by all that stuff.

Still, that wasn't main reason to cease almost all OSS activity and blogging. My daughter was born this march. That brings in more things to do, more responsibility. All that means that it is unknown when I can start to write OSS again. Hopefully, I find some time this summer.

Life is hard. Nevertheless, it's beautiful. Hope you all will have nice summer.
